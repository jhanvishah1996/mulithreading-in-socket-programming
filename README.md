# mulithreading-in-socket-programming
Three programs ( two clients on single server ) 
 1. run the server program first
 
 2.run the client 1 program which will create thread1 
 
3. run the client 2 program which will create thread2
 
 4. every time you run the client, it will create a thread

5. output will be thread1 and thread 2 according to the client program (it matches the string which client sends to server)

6. multiple clients can be connected to the server , here in this case its two.
 
 it showcases a basic program for how multiple clients can be connected to a single server using multithreading.
